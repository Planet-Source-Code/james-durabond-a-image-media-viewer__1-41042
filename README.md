## A Image/Media Viewer


</div>

### Description

This is a very basic program. Basically it loads pictures into a image box from a list of files. The program has an integrated Media Player control to allow the user to view pictures, movies, and listen to most music files (incl.MP3) This program is intended for beginners but also works great for just previewing images without loading up your photo editor utility. Finally I've included a little bit of form animation to give it that special touch. Enjoy!
